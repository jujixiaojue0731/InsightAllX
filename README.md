## Overview

**InsightAll** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [insightAll](https://github.com/insightAll), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience - no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, InsightAll provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

InsightAll comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. You can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode**.

## Why InsightAll

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. InsightAll was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.** InsightAll is built directly upon the official **insightAll** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application for a seamless, battery-included experience. We stay closely aligned with upstream insightAll so you can benefit from the latest official capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility.

| Challenge | InsightAll Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with a guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic Gateway lifecycle management |
| App updates | Startup update checks with a prompt before downloading or installing |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Local-first skill management with an optional extension-provided marketplace |

### Features

- **🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier**: Complete setup through an intuitive graphical interface - no terminal commands, YAML files, or environment-variable hunting.
- **💬 Intelligent Chat Interface**: Multi-session context and history, streaming Markdown with syntax highlighting, CJK-aware parsing, tables, KaTeX math, direct `@agent` routing, inline `/skill` cards, workspace-first sessions, and read-only previews for Markdown, `.docx`, `.pptx`, and local HTML.
- **📡 Multi-Channel Management**: Configure and monitor independent AI channels with multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, default-account switching, and the bundled official Tencent personal WeChat channel plugin.
- **⏰ Cron-Based Automation**: Define recurring or one-time schedules, insert skills into scheduled prompts, and deliver results to external channels.
- **🧩 Extensible Skill System**: Manage skills locally without depending on the Gateway, discover skills from multiple insightAll sources, and use bundled document-processing skills for `pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pptx`.
- **🔐 Secure Provider Integration**: Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, Z.AI / GLM, and other providers with credentials stored in the native system keychain; supports OAuth, custom providers, image-generation endpoints, and compatibility fallbacks.
- **🌙 Adaptive Theming**: Choose light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes.
- **🚀 Startup Launch Control**: Enable **Launch at system startup** in **Settings -> General**.
- **🔔 Update Prompts**: Check for new versions at startup and choose whether to download or install them.

> For full feature details, see [docs/en-US/features.md](docs/en-US/features.md).

### Typical Use Cases

- **🤖 Personal AI Assistant**: Configure a general-purpose AI agent to answer questions, draft emails, summarize documents, and help with everyday tasks from a clean desktop interface.
- **📊 Automated Monitoring**: Schedule agents to monitor news feeds, track prices, or watch for specific events, with results delivered to your preferred notification channel.
- **💻 Developer Productivity**: Integrate AI into your development workflow for code review, documentation generation, and repetitive coding tasks.
- **🔄 Workflow Automation**: Chain multiple skills into visual automation pipelines that process data, transform content, and trigger actions.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/InsightAll/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/InsightAll.git
cd InsightAll

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```

### First Launch

When you launch InsightAll for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** - Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** - Add providers with API keys or OAuth for providers that support browser or device login
3. **Skill Bundles** - Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** - Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Web search note: InsightAll disables insightAll's general-purpose `web_search` tool at both the agent and Gateway policy layers. This includes Moonshot (Kimi) search; managed browser automation and `web_fetch` remain available.
>
> Internal tool note: InsightAll also disables `gateway`, `nodes`, `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal` for agents at both policy layers. Application-owned Gateway RPCs remain available, as do messaging, session orchestration, and agent discovery tools.

### Proxy Settings

InsightAll includes built-in proxy settings for Electron, the insightAll Gateway, and channels such as Telegram that need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings -> Gateway -> Proxy** to configure the default proxy, bypass rules, and optional developer-mode overrides for HTTP, HTTPS, and `ALL_PROXY` / SOCKS. A local example is `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.

> For proxy fallback behavior, Telegram synchronization, and **insightAll Doctor**, see [docs/en-US/proxy-settings.md](docs/en-US/proxy-settings.md).

## Architecture

InsightAll uses a **dual-process architecture with a unified Host API layer**: the React renderer calls one client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection, Gateway lifecycle, and the ACP Chat stdio bridge.

- **Process model**: Electron Main owns the window, Gateway supervision, system integration, and updates; the insightAll Gateway provides AI orchestration, channel, and skill capabilities; the renderer does not access local endpoints directly.
- **Configuration delivery**: Main uses `config.get`/`config.set` while the Gateway is running and updates the resolved JSON5 config while it is stopped or starting; ordinary provider, agent, skill, and model changes do not replace the process, credentials are hot-reloaded through `secrets.reload`, and guarded recovery starts after four consecutive heartbeat misses.
- **ACP Chat**: Chat UI talks to insightAll via [ACP (Agent Client Protocol)](https://agentclientprotocol.com), providing a relatively stable chat protocol surface in front of the rapidly iterating insightAll. ACP runs through a Main-owned stdio bridge, supporting authenticated history replay after config reloads, streaming across navigation, and Main-validated media, attachments, and file activity. When a guarded Gateway restart interrupts an accepted turn, the patched insightAll runtime explicitly links its recovery run to the original ACP prompt so subsequent text and tool activity continue in the same in-memory turn; later history replay restores persisted tool boundaries as native ACP updates.
- **Design principles**: One frontend entry point, Main-owned transport, graceful recovery with reconnect/timeout/backoff, secure storage, and CORS-safe boundaries.

> For the process diagram, configuration coordination, ACP file activity semantics, and Gateway troubleshooting, see [docs/en-US/architecture.md](docs/en-US/architecture.md).

## Development
