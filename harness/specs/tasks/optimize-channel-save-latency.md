id: optimize-channel-save-latency
title: Return promptly after durable channel saves while activation continues
type: ai-coding-task
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Reduce the time the channel configuration modal remains blocked by returning after configuration and binding commits, while plugin activation uses one Gateway lifecycle path without racing native config reloads.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Saving a plugin-backed channel returns as soon as its configuration and scoped binding are durably committed instead of waiting for Gateway stop, startup, and readiness.
  - The Channels page immediately reloads the committed local configuration and then converges to runtime connection state after the scheduled Gateway restart.
  - Changed plugin configuration uses insightAll's native config reload without an additional insightAllX full restart when insightAll peer link repair succeeds; a failed peer link repair schedules the guarded restart path after the config commit, and no-change retries still use that path when plugin discovery is required.
  - A config commit whose acknowledgement is lost to native reload is verified from the durable config instead of being reported as a false save failure.
  - A stale owned process that fails to recover from an in-process restart is terminated promptly and replaced instead of holding startup for the full cold-start retry budget.
  - Restart failures remain visible through normal Gateway status and logging rather than becoming unhandled promise rejections.

acceptance:
  - The save response exposes when plugin activation is pending.
  - A changed plugin config relies on the coordinator-owned config.set reload without a redundant full restart when peer link repair succeeds, and schedules a guarded full restart after commit when peer link repair fails.
  - A no-change plugin save starts a guarded Gateway restart only after the scoped binding commit completes.
  - The save response does not await Gateway restart readiness.
  - Immediate post-save refresh is config-only and does not issue an expensive runtime probe while Gateway is restarting.
  - No Renderer transport or direct Gateway request is added.
