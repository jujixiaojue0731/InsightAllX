title: Remove the insightAllX Dreams integration
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Remove the developer-only insightAllX Dreams page and its dedicated Control UI view while preserving generic Gateway communication, memory capability diagnostics, and existing insightAll dreaming configuration and data.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - insightAllX no longer shows a Dreams navigation item or serves the /dreams route, including when developer mode is enabled.
  - insightAllX continues to open the root insightAll Control UI from existing non-Dreams entry points.
  - Existing insightAll memory-core dreaming configuration and DREAMS.md data are not changed or deleted.

acceptance:
  - No insightAllX production source, route, navigation item, locale namespace, or dedicated Control UI parameter exposes Dreams.
  - The generic hostApi Gateway RPC and root Control UI paths remain available.
  - Gateway memory capability classification and insightAll memory-core configuration support remain unchanged.
  - README and harness guidance no longer describe the removed insightAllX Dreams page or its tests.
