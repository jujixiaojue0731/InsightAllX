Gateway backend communication covers all InsightAll paths that move data between the visual desktop UI and insightAll runtime/backend services.

Coordinator-owned insightAll config mutations and their `config.get`/`config.set` transaction contract are documented in `harness/reference/openclaw-config-delivery.md`.

Allowed flow:
Renderer page/component -> `src/lib/host-api.ts` or `src/lib/api-client.ts` -> Electron Main typed host service or IPC handler -> Main-owned insightAll Gateway WebSocket -> runtime result -> store/UI.

Renderer code must not own transport selection, direct IPC channels, direct Gateway HTTP calls, retry policy, or protocol fallback.

Renderer code must not create direct Gateway WebSocket connections. Gateway frame diagnostics must be emitted by Main-process Gateway logging.

Typed generic Gateway RPC requests are validated by `electron/services/gateway-api.ts` and delegated directly to `GatewayManager.rpc`, including an optional positive finite timeout. This path has no Renderer Chat history/send specialization, polling queue, coalescing, or backpressure layer. ACP `session/load`, `session/prompt`, and `session/cancel` own ordinary Chat history and composer behavior independently.

Channel/plugin migration behavior is also part of this scenario when InsightAll rewrites insightAll config before Gateway launch. Upgrades must preserve single-owner channel registration for migrated plugin-backed channels such as Feishu/Lark.

InsightAll's prelaunch config sanitizer also owns desktop tool policy. It must keep `web_search` in both the agent-level and Gateway-level deny lists without replacing existing deny entries or disabling managed browser automation and `web_fetch`. It must also deny the agent-facing `gateway`, `nodes`, `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal` tools at both layers while preserving application-owned Gateway RPCs. Messaging, session orchestration, and agent discovery tools remain available unless another explicit policy denies them.

Scheduled-task history is Main-owned backend data. Current insightAll versions must be queried through the Gateway `cron.runs` RPC; direct run-log file reads are allowed only as a compatibility fallback for older file-backed runtimes. When a run's bounded summary ends with insightAll's truncation ellipsis, Main may recover the complete final assistant reply from the run transcript identified by that `cron.runs` entry, but only when the transcript reply is longer and shares the entire summary prefix. When a cron base session has no ACP replay, Renderer may project that typed host result into a generation-scoped, in-memory historical ACP timeline, but must not replace or duplicate non-empty ACP replay.

The local HTML Preview privileged bridge is also Main-owned: Renderer may load a validated local HTML file or open that current file externally through the typed Host API. The guest is an implementation detail of the existing `preview` tab; there is no `web-browser` artifact tab or general address navigation. The durable guest contract is `harness/reference/web-browser.md`.

Gateway session-catalog subscription, normalization, ordered list/event replay, attention transitions, and reconnect recovery are documented in `harness/reference/sidebar-session-attention.md`. Electron test-process isolation and global-resource scheduling are documented in `harness/reference/e2e-parallelism.md`.

Gateway WebSocket heartbeat misses are diagnostic availability signals for the first three consecutive misses and must not interrupt long-running work during that window. A pong or any incoming Gateway message resets the sequence. On the fourth consecutive miss, Main may request the guarded Gateway restart path when auto-recovery is enabled and lifecycle state is still running; the heartbeat callback must not directly terminate the socket or process. Authoritative process-exit and socket-close signals retain their existing automatic lifecycle paths.
