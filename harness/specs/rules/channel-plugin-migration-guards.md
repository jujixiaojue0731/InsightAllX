When channel plugin ownership changes between bundled insightAll extensions and external `~/.openclaw/extensions/*` installs, InsightAll must normalize configuration to one active plugin identity per channel.

The InsightAll channel configuration catalog is intentionally limited to `telegram`, `discord`, `whatsapp`, `wechat`, `dingtalk`, `feishu`, `wecom`, and `qqbot`. insightAll may report other channel ids, but the InsightAll Channels page must not expose them as configurable or editable channel groups. Filtering an unsupported runtime channel is presentation-only and must not delete or rewrite that channel's underlying insightAll configuration.

Channel credentials and account maps must remain under `channels.<id>`; `plugins.entries.<id>` is activation metadata and must not contain InsightAll-generated `accounts` or `defaultAccount` fields. Discord, WhatsApp, and QQBot are external plugins in the pinned insightAll runtime and must retain explicit `plugins.allow` and `{ enabled }` entries. Saving changed configuration for a supported external plugin channel while Gateway is running must use the coordinator-owned `config.set` reload without scheduling a second InsightAll full restart when insightAll peer link repair succeeds. When peer link repair fails after plugin install, Main must schedule the guarded full restart after the config commit instead of relying on the native reload alone. A no-change retry must still start the guarded full restart path after the scoped-binding commit so a newly copied or previously undiscovered plugin is loaded. Successful WeChat QR completion must likewise leave plugin activation on a single lifecycle path. The host save response may return while activation is still pending, provided it explicitly reports that state and failures are caught and surfaced through normal Gateway status/logging. If `config.set` durably commits before its response is lost to a native code-1012 reload, Main may verify that exact persisted config and treat the transaction as committed; it must not perform an out-of-band replay.

For Feishu/Lark specifically:

- a configured Feishu channel must not leave both the bundled `feishu` plugin and the legacy external `openclaw-lark` / `feishu-openclaw-plugin` registrations active at the same time
- when the canonical Feishu plugin is external, InsightAll must explicitly disable the bundled `feishu` plugin instead of only removing allowlist entries
- when the Feishu channel is not configured, stale Feishu plugin registrations must be removed from `plugins.allow` and `plugins.entries`
- changes to `electron/utils/openclaw-auth.ts`, `electron/utils/channel-config.ts`, or `electron/gateway/config-sync.ts` that affect channel/plugin migration must keep direct regression coverage for the dual-plugin migration state
